# Sudoku-AutoScan-Solver
# Sudoku Solver

A Python-based application that solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithms. This project takes user input for a Sudoku grid, processes the puzzle, and provides the solution through simulated keystrokes.

## Features

- Input a 9x9 Sudoku grid where empty spaces are represented by zeros.
- Automatically solves the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
- Displays the solution by simulating keyboard inputs with `pyautogui`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pyautogui` library
- `numpy` library (if you plan to use it for any future enhancements)
